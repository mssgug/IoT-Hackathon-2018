One of Share IT's key technology is the ability to use facial recognition for member authentication.

Baseline Code was forked from:
https://github.com/Azure-Samples/Custom-vision-service-iot-edge-raspberry-pi

ImageClassifierService was modified to use trained model (from customvision.ai) for facial logins.     
SenseHatDisplay was modified to display based on logins (numeric instead of fruits.)

Lessons (Resolutions) while implementing the solution:
* Encountered device startup issue. Solved by updating the String Primary Key. Primary key should also include HostName and DeviceId. SharedAccessKey alone is not enough.
* Documentation is not the same when opened in different browsers. For example: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-edge/quickstart-linux One shows the steps using Azure CLI. The other version shows how to create using GUI. Resolution: For the wanted document version, export it as PDF and share to the rest of the team.
* Dockerfile build fails with "exec format error". Resolution: Ideally this should work (but needed further investigation). Meanwhile, this error was by passed by removing **RUN [ "cross-build-start" ]** from the dockerfile.
